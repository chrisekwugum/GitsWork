This is a new work and  I am new to using git and github. 
i had challenges and this code or command seems to work
"
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/chrisekwugum/GitsWork.git
"
"
 git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories
"

I have just seen this, this command below helped out
" git pull  https://github.com/chrisekwugum/GitsWork.git main"
